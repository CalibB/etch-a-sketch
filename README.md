# Etch-a-Sketch

This application is a hybrid between sketchpad and etch-a-sketch. Main purpose here is to
show my command on DOM skills.

## Overview
- Users will be presented with a predefined grid that's 16x16.
- If the user hovers their mouse over each individual block, you'll notice that the colour changes and lingers for a few seconds before disappearing. Sort of leaving a trail.
- Users will also notice a button atop of the grid that when clicked, they'll get prompted to enter a preferred grid dimension up to 100x100.
